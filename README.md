# Inspirations
list of inspirations that i caught in daily life

1. Point of view for analyzing data 

- Smoking room

I have one cafe that i usally go to study near my home. </br>
This cafe is consisted with 2 floor - 1F is for cashier and 2F is for seats and smoking room. </br>
Because i am a smoking person, i need to smoke regularlly even more when i'm studying(Just for encouraging concentration haha). </br>
So this place is so nice for me. For me, Smoking time gives many good affects. </br>
Usally it gives me a break time, relieves my stess, organizes my thought and sometimes gives me an opportunity for deep thinking. 
So this cafe's smoking room is my favorite place. </br>
</br>
One day i had been this cafe with my friend and go smoking room together. </br>
There is two big ashtray and 6 chairs. When i was smoking in there, sometimes i just caught many brands of cigarettes in ashtray and thought about people's preference cigarette brand. </br>
It's a kinda occupational disease that analyzing data and figuring out meaningful result haha. </br>
But this thought was not interesting to me becaus i thought anybody can think about it when they saw ashtray. </br>
</br>
My friend (who is not concerned with my major even with studying haha) told me something very fresh. </br>
(before we get started, here is picture to help your understanding with smoking room's view)

Freind : "Did you see? Everyone didn't threw their cigarette into the ashtray on the opposite side of the chairs!"</br>
Me : "What? Oh i see. yeah it's true. There are no cigarettes at ashtray on the side which are not looking for chairs. but so what?"</br>
Friend : "It means everybody smoked and threw away their cigarretes while sitting. and nobody didn't smoked while standing"</br>
Me : Oh my goodness... it's a kinda fresh shocking man..."</br>
</br>
Yeah it was quite fresh result with analyzing that place. </br>
I just always thought about people's preference cigarette brand with counting several cigarattes. and my friend thought was so fresh and new to me.</br>
With this episode, i realized point of view for analzing and wathching data is so important. </br>
One of data scientist's needed ability is wide perspective to interpret and analyze data. </br>
As You saw above, various perspective(point of view) can make various thinking and interpretation.</br>
With various interpretation, data scientists can make good decisions for something.</br>
So im gonna find a way for widening perspective to interpret something and do that way.</br>
Maybe i think one of that way is reading books. Also talk with diverse people and notice how they see the world.</br>
